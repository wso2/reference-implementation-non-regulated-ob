# Automated setup

These scripts do everything in [TRYOUT.md](../TRYOUT.md) up to calling the APIs. When they finish,
you import the generated Postman collection and run it.

## Before you start

You need:

- API Manager 4.7.0 and Identity Server 7.3.0 zips, and the `wso2-fsam-accelerator-4.0.0` and
  `wso2-fsiam-accelerator-4.0.0` zips
- A running MySQL 8, and the MySQL JDBC driver jar
- Java 8 and Maven, to build this repo, and a JDK supported by the servers
- `jq`, `curl`, `openssl`, `python3`, `unzip` and `keytool`

## Run it

```bash
cp setup/setup.env.example setup/setup.env   # then fill it in
setup/setup.sh extract
setup/setup.sh update                        # asks for your WSO2 login; required (see below)
setup/setup.sh accelerators certs deploy start configure-apim register-rar onboard postman
```

`setup/setup.sh all` runs every phase except `update`.

`update` needs a WSO2 subscription. It's required for these product versions: the accelerator zips
only have the `deployment.toml` templates up to API Manager 4.5.0 and Identity Server 7.1.0, and the
updates add the 4.7.0 and 7.3.0 ones. Without them, `accelerators` stops.

> `accelerators` **drops and recreates** the MySQL databases whose names start with `DB_PREFIX`
> (default `nonreg_ob_`), and `certs` replaces both servers' keys.

Every phase can be run again on its own, for example `setup/setup.sh deploy`. Use
`setup/setup.sh stop` and `setup/setup.sh start` to stop and start the servers.

| Phase | Does | TRYOUT step |
|---|---|---|
| `extract` | Extracts the products and copies the accelerators into them | 1, 2 |
| `update` | WSO2 updates for products and accelerators | 1, 2 |
| `accelerators` | JDBC driver, `configure.properties`, `merge.sh`, `configure.sh` | 2 |
| `certs` | Server certificates, truststores, client application keys and JWKS | 3, 4 |
| `deploy` | Webapps, error formatter, approval workflow, `deployment.toml` changes | 5, 6, 9 |
| `start` | JWKS server, Identity Server, API Manager | 7 |
| `configure-apim` | Key manager, policies, both APIs published | 8, 10 |
| `register-rar` | RAR types in Identity Server, admin access to the consent APIs | 11, 12 |
| `onboard` | Developer sign-up, client application, subscriptions, keys, RAR authorization, customer | 13, 14, 15 |
| `postman` | Configured Postman collection | 15 |

## Then, in Postman

1. Import the collection from `setup/.state/postman/`.
2. **Settings** → **General**: turn off **SSL certificate verification**.
3. **Settings** → **Certificates**: add `setup/.state/client/transport.pem` and `transport.key` for
   `localhost:9446` and `localhost:8243`.
4. Run folder `00` once, then each other folder in order. In the Authorize step, sign in as the customer
   (`CUSTOMER_USERNAME` / `CUSTOMER_PASSWORD` in `setup.env`).
